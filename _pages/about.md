Hello! I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Sankaran Lab](https://www.bloodgenes.org/) at Boston Children's Hospital and the Broad Institute. I obtained my PhD in [Bioinformatics & Integrative Genomics](https://bigphd.hms.harvard.edu/) from Harvard Medical School, co-advised by [Peter Kharchenko](https://altoslabs.com/team/principal-investigators-san-diego/peter-kharchenko/) and [Peter Park](https://compbio.hms.harvard.edu/people/peter-j-park). Before starting graduate school, I was a computational biologist at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://componcmsk.org/) in New York City. Before that, I studied computer science and biology at Washington University ('18).

The focus of my current research is using single-cell genomics to unravel (hematopoietic) stem cell dynamics in aging and regeneration. Previously, I developed a widely used computational method for single-cell analysis of genomic and transcriptional aberrations in cancer ([Gao et al 2022, Nat. Biotech.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-022-01468-y)), and discovered that cells with chromosomal alterations accumulate in somatic tissues with age ([Gao et al 2023, Nat. Genet.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-023-01537-1)). My ultimate goal as a scientist is to enable regenerative therapies for cancer and other age-associated diseases.
