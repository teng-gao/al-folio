Hello! I am a PhD student in the [Bioinformatics & Integrative Genomics](https://bigphd.hms.harvard.edu/) program at Harvard Medical School, co-advised by [Peter Kharchenko](https://altoslabs.com/team/principal-investigators-san-diego/peter-kharchenko/) and [Peter Park](https://compbio.hms.harvard.edu/people/peter-j-park). Before starting graduate school, I was a computational biologist at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://componcmsk.org/) in New York City. Before that, I studied computer science and biology at Washington University.

My current research interest lies in the intersection of aging and cancer biology, leveraging the most recent genomics technologies. Some of my prior works in this area include detecting age-related acquisition of DNA mutations in the blood of 32,000 individuals ([Gao et al 2021, Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20565-7)) and single-cell analysis of genomic and transcriptional aberrations in cancer ([Gao et al 2022, Nature Biotechnology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-022-01468-y)). My ultimate goal as a scientist is to prevent cancer and other age-associated diseases.
